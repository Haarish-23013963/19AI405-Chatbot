# 19AI405-Chatbot

## AIM
To develop a simple chatbot using Python that can interact with users through text-based conversation.


## SOFTWARE USED
Python 3.12.1

## ALGORITHM
1. Start the program.

2. Initialize a knowledge base to store predefined keywords and responses in a Python dictionary.

3. Take user input from the terminal.

4. Convert input to lowercase to make matching easier.

5. Search for keywords in the user’s message that match entries in the knowledge base.

6. If a match is found, display a random response from the related list.

7. If no match is found, return a default message such as “I’m not sure about that. Please rephrase your question.”

8. Repeat until the user types 'exit' or 'quit'.

9. End the program.
